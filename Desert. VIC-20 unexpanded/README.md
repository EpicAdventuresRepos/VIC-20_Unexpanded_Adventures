# Desert

A grid game for your unexpanded VIC-20. Written in assembly.

You travel across the locations of the desert trying to arrive to the city with life.
Every time you move, you lose one point of water. If you have no water, you will lose one point of life. 
You play writing commands:
North, South East West. You move across the desert using the cardinal points. 
Look. This command repeats the description of the location you are. 
Drink. If you find an oasis, you can drink water.
Take. If you are lucky enough, you will find items that will help you to survive.
Inventory. Tells you the items you carry, if any.

And more.
